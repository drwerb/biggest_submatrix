# biggest_submatrix

Here is my implementation of algorithm described in article http://algolist.manual.ru/maths/linalg/fmaxpminor.php
The algorithm defines the biggest submatrix filled with 1 only inside matrix. The matrix can contain only 1 or 0.
The algorithm complexity is O(matrixWidth x matrixLength)
