# biggest_submatrix

Here is my implementation of algorithm described in article http://algolist.manual.ru/maths/linalg/fmaxpminor.php
The algorithm defines the biggest submatrix filled with 1 only inside matrix. The matrix can contain only 1 or 0.
The algorithm complexity is O(matrixWidth x matrixLength)

This is is just code snippet that is cut from another project. It was not useful for that task as another more suitable approach was find. But it might be handy in some other case.
